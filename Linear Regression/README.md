# HW2 - Linear Regression

## Required Libraries

To run the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- **Pandas**
- **Numpy**
- **Matplotlib** (Optional, for plotting)

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## How to Run the Code

Make sure you are inside the `Linear Regression` folder.

### Running Batch Gradient Descent
To run the Batch Gradient Descent implementation:
```bash
python3 BGD.py
```

### Running Stochastic Gradient Descent
To run the Stochastic Gradient Descent implementation:
```bash
python3 SGD.py
```

### Running Analytical weight calculations:
To run the the analytical weight calculation implementation:
```bash
python3 q4-c.py
```

### Generating Plots
To generate plots for the results, run:
```bash
python3 plot_graph.py
```

## Results

The results, including the generated plots and CSV files containing the output from the above code, are stored in the `results` folder.
