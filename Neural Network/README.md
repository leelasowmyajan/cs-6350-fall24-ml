```bash
python3 neural_network.py
```

### Running Bonus Question
To run the Bonus Question implementation:
```bash
python3 bonus.py
```

### Tweaking Parameters
If you want to modify parameters like:
**HIDDEN_LAYER_SIZES**, **maximum number of epochs (T)**, **NETWORK_DEPTHS**, **TRAINING_MODES**, **TRAINING_BATCH_SIZE**, you can adjust the values in the `utilities.py` file located in this folder.
